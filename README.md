CAPSTONE Project
University CAPSTONE project.
Theme will be Classification and Sentiment Analysis.
The intention is to use Twitter feeds to build Opionion mining sentiment analysis engine to determine the polarity of twitter tweets using ngrams.  These ngrams will be compared to a database of known phrases and words that have been previously assigned sentiment.  Further evaluation will determine the validity of the tweets (only news sources/articles will be used from tweets) to access the probablity of the article/news/tweet being false or fake news.  Results will be displayed graphically.
